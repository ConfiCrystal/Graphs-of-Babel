This project, as detailed on the home page, is a series of interesting and occasionaly absurd graphs, explored and visualized through various intuitive systems.
It is also a PWA (Progressive Web App), with functioning service workers, version tracking, and installation capabilities.

To avoid upkeep costs, the application is not currently hosted, but can be hosted locally and subsequently downloaded.
I hope you enjoy exploring the content within!
